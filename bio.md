Hello, my name is Frank Eslami. I enjoy coding, though it's mostly a love-hate relationship, with much hair pulling.

I love nothing more than the crackling of of a bon fire and the mist of the morning dew with a great book at hand.

<h1>Programming Background</h1>
I took assembly langauge, which I loved.
I also took data structures, which I loved.

My goal by the end of this quarter is to create websites for businesses to support myself until I graduate from OSU.
